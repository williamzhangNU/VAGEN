<h3>Turn 1</h3>
<div class='panel user'><strong>User</strong><br># Spatial Exploration Task

Your goal: Learn ALL spatial relationships between EACH pair of objects in the room.

## Direction Format:
Spatial relationships are described using (&lt;horizontal&gt;, &lt;vertical&gt;) format:
- **horizontal**: left, right, same
- **vertical**: front, back, same
- &quot;same&quot; means objects are aligned in that dimension (e.g., (front, same) means center front)

## Face direction
There are EXACTLY four facing directions: north, south, east, west. No other directions exist.
Suppose you are facing north, then:
- **forward**: north (same direction as you)
- **backward**: south (opposite direction as you)
- **right**: east (90° clockwise)
- **left**: west (90° counterclockwise)

## Critical Requirements:
1. **Complete Coverage**: 
   - Explore until you know where every object is relative to every other object. Only stop when you have all spatial relationships.
   - Only know relationships between object and yourself is NOT enough.
2. **Be Efficient** (Avoid redundant observations):
   - Focus on areas where you expect to eliminate some unknown relationships
   - If you know all objects are in one general direction but lack specific details, focus your exploration there 
      - (e.g., if all objects are to your left but you don&#x27;t know which are in front vs. back, explore the left side systematically)
3. **Stop When Done**: End exploration as soon as you have all spatial relationships

## Important Notes:
- Focus on **directional relationships** between objects, not exact distances
- Pay careful attention to the precise positions of objects in your field of view (left-front, **center-front**, right-front) to accurately determine spatial relationships.
- In each image, a red dashed line indicates the agent&#x27;s center front direction.

After exploration, you return to starting position to answer questions.

## Room Layout
Imagine yourself as agent in a room.
You are facing north.
Objects in the room: green chair, blue chair, basket


## Action Instructions
You can move in the room and turn around to observe the room.

Available Actions:
Movement Actions:
- Move(object_name): Move to the same position as the object. You can ONLY move to object within your field of view. You can ONLY move to objects by name, not directions or others. Invalid examples: Move(left), Move(forward), Move(back)
- Rotate(degrees): Rotate by specified degrees, only valid degrees are 0, 90, 180, 270.
- Return(): Return to the starting anchor position

Final Actions:
- Observe(): Observe spatial relationships of all objects in the field of view relative to your current position. You can only observe objects that are within your field of view.
- Term(): Terminate the exploration phase

Answer with following format:
Movement: [&lt;movement_action1&gt;, &lt;movement_action2&gt;, ...]; Final: &lt;final_action&gt;

Format Notes:
- Use movement actions in Movement, and final action in Final.
- If no movement is needed, use [] in Movement.
- Actions in Movement will be executed in order.
- Separated these two lines by a semicolon.

Examples:
Valid Example:
Movement: [Move(table), Rotate(90)]; Final: Observe()

Valid Example (no movement):
Movement: []; Final: Observe()

Invalid Example (wrong order):
Final: Observe(); Movement: []



Rules:
- Term() must be alone (no movement actions)
- You have a field of view for observation: 90 degrees.


You have a maximum of 3 exploration steps.

Since I have no exploration steps left, I must conclude the spatial relationships based on what I know. The basket is (right, same) relative to the blue chair because basket is north and blue chair is west. The green chair&#x27;s position relative to others is unknown, so I cannot fully complete all pairwise relationships. However, I have exhausted all exploration steps.

## Evaluation Question
You will perform a full 360-degree rotation by continuously turning clockwise in place.
As you rotate, imagine a narrow spotlight beam projecting straight ahead from your current viewpoint.
This beam represents your direct line of sight and sweeps across the environment as you turn.

**CRITICAL: Objects are only visible when you turn to face them directly.**
- An object is &#x27;directly in front&#x27; when the beam points straight at it
Your task is to identify sequence of objects that becomes visible as your beam points directly at it during the full rotation.

Instructions:
- Do **not** include any object at your current position
- Assume a smooth, continuous 360° rotation that will point directly at every possible angle

Answer Format:
List all visible objects, separated by commas: &lt;obj1&gt;, &lt;obj2&gt;, ...

Example:
table, bookshelf, sofa

Always output: &lt;think&gt; [Your thoughts] &lt;/think&gt; &lt;answer&gt; [your answer] &lt;/answer&gt; with no extra text.</div>
<div class='panel think'><strong>Agent Think</strong><br>From the exploration, I know the basket is directly north of the starting position, the blue chair is directly west, and the green chair was not seen but must be somewhere else, likely south. As I rotate clockwise starting facing north, I will first see the basket, then the green chair (likely south), then the blue chair (west). The order of visibility during a 360-degree clockwise rotation is basket, green chair, blue chair.</div>

## Evaluation Question
You will perform a full 360-degree rotation by continuously turning clockwise in place.
As you rotate, imagine a narrow spotlight beam projecting straight ahead from your current viewpoint.
This beam represents your direct line of sight and sweeps across the environment as you turn.

**CRITICAL: Objects are only visible when you turn to face them directly.**
- An object is &#x27;directly in front&#x27; when the beam points straight at it
Your task is to identify sequence of objects that becomes visible as your beam points directly at it during the full rotation.

Instructions:
- Do **not** include any object at your current position
- Assume a smooth, continuous 360° rotation that will point directly at every possible angle

Answer Format:
List all visible objects, separated by commas: &lt;obj1&gt;, &lt;obj2&gt;, ...

Example:
table, bookshelf, sofa

Always output: &lt;think&gt; [Your thoughts] &lt;/think&gt; &lt;answer&gt; [your answer] &lt;/answer&gt; with no extra text.</div>
<div class='panel think'><strong>Agent Think</strong><br>From the exploration, I know the kettle is directly east of the starting position. The white chair and blue chair were never seen, so they must be located in other directions. Since the kettle is east, and I started facing north with no objects visible, the chairs must be located either north, south, or west. Given the room layout and typical arrangement, it is likely the two chairs are positioned in different directions. As I rotate 360 degrees clockwise starting facing north, I will see objects in the order of their directions: first the white chair, then the blue chair, then the kettle. The exact order depends on their relative positions, but since the kettle is east, it will appear after north and west directions. Without exact data, the best assumption is the chairs are north and west or north and south. The only object I know for sure is the kettle at east. I will list the objects in the order they would appear rotating clockwise: white chair, blue chair, kettle.</div>
